# [FORKED](https://github.com/conceptadev/typeorm-seeding/commit/91cba4193996b1826bf2fe637fa3cfb8d5adf468) `jorgebodega/typeorm-seeding@3.2.0`

### Thank You

- A big thanks to [Jorge Bodega](https://github.com/jorgebodega/typeorm-seeding) for improving this module
  beyond TypeORM Seeding v1.6.0 when it became idle. Ultimately we decided to go in a different direction for
  TypeORM v0.3.0 support, but his contributions were crucial.
